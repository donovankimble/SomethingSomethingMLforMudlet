# SomethingSomethingMLforMudlet
Probably overambitious for a first coding project, but trying to make a Nueral Network for a Mud that I play on.
Using lua because I'm bad at coding, and it's the default language for mudlet's trigger scripts.
By the time I commit what I've been working on, it should have horrible versions of gradient descent, binary classification, and a probably nonfunctional version of multiple classification that I just decided to call good...
